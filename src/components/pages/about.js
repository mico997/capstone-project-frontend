            Ill start by introducing myself. Im Mike Vidal and iam a Junior
            Developer and beginner in React.js. The Idea of distributing mask
            all started in march of 2020 when the Corona Virus Pandemic began.
            During the initial state of the pandemic, people weren't aware of
            the appropriate mask to wear. Alot of people wore surgical mask and
            others used bare cloths as mask. There were hardly any N95 mask
            which where the appropriate mask to wear during a pandemic. Or if
            there were any available, you had to look entensively to be even be
            lucky to get one. Since i had some experience from selling
            merchandise online using dropshipping, i decided to use thesame
            method and here we are!
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
